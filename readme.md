This is a roadmap for learning x86 assembly, using
[nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) on Linux. I will try to list the topics as I
learn, sorting them from the most basic to most advanced, adding a series of
small tasks for each topic.

As I complete each task/topic, a check mark (✓) will be added to the item
and a pointer to the solution will be provided.

# Roadmap

## The Basics

* ✓ Install the necessary tools (`installation/`)

  * ✓ Install `ld` (most Linux distros already come with have this installed)

  * ✓ Install `nasm` (`installation/nasm.md`)

* Assemble and run a program that "does nothing", and check the return value

* Make a "hello world" program

* Registers

  * Register names and sizes.

  * The `mov` instruction.

  * Write a program that moves values between registers of different sizes.

* Unconditional Jump

* Flags and comparisons

* Conditional Jump

* The Stack

* Addresses and Pointers
